I have incorporated the following components of Classical Vision in my programs:



1. Color Deconvolution: Differenciating the features on the basis of colors. 

2. Edge Based Segmentation using Canny Edge Detector: Segmentation involves segmenting objects from the background.

3. Region Based Segmentation using Sobel Filter and Watershed Transform : Segmentation involves segmenting objects from the background.

4. Geometrical Transformations: Resizing images using Seam Carving

.

The programs have been compiled using Python Jupyter Notebooks and detailed comments regarding methodologies are included in the individual respective programs.
